# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly the sharp increase during the Covid-19 pandemic. The analysis involves using Python to process and visualize unemployment data. Key steps include:


### **Data Collection:** 
Gathering unemployment data from reliable sources such as government databases or public datasets.

### **Data Preprocessing:** 
Cleaning the data by handling missing values, normalizing formats, and preparing it for analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends, seasonal patterns, and geographical distributions in the unemployment data.

### **Time Series Analysis:** 
Implementing time series analysis to understand the changes over time and the impact of significant events like Covid-19 on unemployment rates.

### **Visualization:** 
Creating insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively, including line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.
